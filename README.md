# -School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis: 
This school district analysis is to determine if there were signs of academic dishonest among 9th graders in Thomas High School. In order to do this, we removed those students' math and reading scores from the data set and compared to the reast of the data.  

## Results:
